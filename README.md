# Structures

## About
Repository containing major data structures implemented from scratch in C. 

The implementation is inspired by David R. Hanson's implementation of various data structures.

## Implemented Stuctures
As of now, the following data structures have been implemented:
1. Binary Search Tree
 - Builds an array based binary search-tree on top of the UArray data structure.
2. Heap
- Generic implementation that implements either a min heap or a max heap specified during initialization and insertion.
- Is an array based implementation using the UArray data structure.
3. LinkedList:
- A simple singly-linked list implementation.
4. Queue:
- First In First Out (FIFO) data structure built on top of the UArray data structure.
5. Stack:
- First in Last Out (FILO) data structure built on top of the UArray data structure.
6. UArray:
- A simple implementation of a dynamic one-dimensional array
7. UArray2:
- An implementation of a static TWO dimensional array build on top of the UArray data structure.
8. UArray2b:
- A **blocked** two dimension array implementation.
- Using blocks virtually partitions the data in an n x n block such that mapping is faster in certain situations. This implementation prioritises efficiency. 
- Built on top of the UArray data structure.

## In Progress
The following data structures are currently in progress:
1. Graph
